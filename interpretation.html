                While there are many interpretations of the story of Prometheus, the themes of sacrifice, defiance, and the advocation of human progress and knowledge remain consistent. Prometheus was a titan and one who represented semi-divinity and was subservient to the gods of Olympus. His actions of stealing fire represent a rebellion against divine authority. It can be seen as a representation of the values of freedom and the challenges of authoritative hierarchies. Prometheusâ€™ punishment by the gods for the sake of human progress embellishes the themes of sacrifice. It shows the downsides of progress and how loss and sacrifice are sometimes needed for long-term prosperity.
